The bayes.py library can be used to simulate comparison audits of lists
of ballot interpretations as reported by a voting system,
compared with lists of manual ballot interpretations.
Run it to see the output of its doctests.

See notes.txt for documentation on the audit.py code
to control bayes.py audits via the file system.
