# 2017-bayes-audit

This repository contains prototype code for implementing Bayesian
post-election audits.

The Colorado statewide post-election audits in November 2017 provide
motivation for developing this code.

The following paper by Rivest and Shen (2012) provides the original
description of Bayesian post-election audits:
    "A Bayesian Method for Auditing Elections"
    by Ronald L. Rivest and Emily Shen (2012).

More details can be found in the paper (warning: unfinished work-in-progress):
    "Bayesian Post-Election Tabulation Audits Explained and Extended"
    by Ronald L. Rivest (Draft; 2017)
    [Bayesian Post-Election Tabulation Audits Explained and Extended](bayes-explained/bayesx.pdf)
    
Prototype code for Bayesian post-election audit was also developed for
possible use in the 2016 Australian Senate elections.  See the paper:
