# Documentation for multi.py (Bayeian audit support program)

``multi.py`` is Python3 software (or suite of programs) to support
the post-election auditing of elections with multiple contests and
multiple separately-managed collections of paper ballots.

The software is designed to be helpful for auditing elections such as
the November 2017 Colorado election, which has hundreds of contests
spread across 64 counties.

## Election structure

We presume that the election has a number of **contests**, a number of
**voters**, each of whom submits a single **paper ballots**.
